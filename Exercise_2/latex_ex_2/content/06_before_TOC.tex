\section*{Abstract}
Dear Professor Rupp. Tried handing in some stuff before midnight, the plot for 1.a!
It is not finished, but I handed something in before 23:59, I hope you appreciate the loophole identified by me enough to grant me the point!
See you soon and have a nice evening. Camilo Tello Fachin
