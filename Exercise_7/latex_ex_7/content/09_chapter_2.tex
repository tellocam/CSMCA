\subsection{Comparison of Pipelined CG and Classical CG on both GPU's (2/2 Points)}


\subsubsection{CG Algorithm Performance on RTX3060}
For this specific implementation, the runtime for the pipelined CG algorithm on the RTX3060 outperforms the classic one only for $\sqrt{\mathrm{N}}$ larger than approximately 300.
After this point, the imporvements of the pipelined algorithm appear to be only minor.

\subsubsection{CG Algorithm Performance on Tesla K40}
For this specific implementation, the runtime for the pipelined CG algorithm on the Tesla K40 outperforms the classic one only for $\sqrt{\mathrm{N}}$ larger than approximately 350.
After this point, the imporvements of the pipelined algorithm appear to be only minor.
